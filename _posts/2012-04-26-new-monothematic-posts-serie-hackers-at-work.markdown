## Intro

Writing a blog to fill the gaps between application developers and security
professionals may sound too much _primetime diva_ boosting her knowledge.

It may sound a bit pretentious to me talking about filling a gap in two
differents IT fields. I have a lot of things yet to learn. That's why I asked
other professionals from both the worlds to join the ride and helping me in
saying building a bridge between those two worlds is somewhat very easy.

## Chorus

_Hackers at work_ will be a journey through some IT superstars everyday work to
see how do they approach web development and IT security.

We will see the technologies they use, the tools they write, what does
influence them most and much more.
The format will be a written interview, no podcast nor screencast at the
moment.

But I don't exlude we will make something like [peepcode](http://peepcode.com)
play by play series applied to application security.
