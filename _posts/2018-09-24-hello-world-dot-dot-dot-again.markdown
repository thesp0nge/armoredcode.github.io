It was 2014 when I wrote the latest post on armoredcode.com. It was about [Ruby patching Wednesday](https://armoredcode.com/blog/rails-patching-wednesday/) and tons of stuff changed in my life.

I started a companion blog in Italian language only, [codiceinsicuro.it](https://codiceinsicuro.it) with more than 300 unique visitors every day. I learned python and I got back in the offensive security world, rather than being on the wave of chitchatting about something I'd love to do.

I took the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) and [SLAE32](http://www.securitytube-training.com/online-courses/securitytube-linux-assembly-expert/index.html) certifications and next goal will be [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/) I planned to accomplish in 2019.

A lot of stuff changed, I said. And [this blog](https://armoredcode.com) is one of them.

This is a soft and quite blog reboot. I'll start writing again in English about offensive security, defensive programming, blue and red team and everything related.

So, hello world... again!
