Today I launched a first minimal website for
[codesake.com](http://codesake.com). The website is very minimal and just a
_subcribe to beta program web form_ it is present on the homepage.

In this interconnected era it is so easy to try to use what you know to create
a business. Sometimes [you succeded](http://www.apple.com), sometimes [you fail](http://www.volunia.it). 

It's life.

Most of the startups are devoted to consumer market, trying to mimic facebook
exploding raise since its very beginnings. codesake.com it will be a different
startup, with services target to developers and to enterprises.

The idea is that application security stuff, code reviews, safe coding hints,
must be present in a development team workout. As when you go to the gym, it's
very risky to improvise yourself a security professional.

codesake.com will be your appsec personal trainer.

In the following days I'll create a [blog](http://blog.codesake.com) and small _tryout_
[form](http://codesake.com/try) you can use to test a snippet of code seeing
codesake.com overall improvements and that it will available next days to beta testers. 

[armoredcode.com](http://armoredcode.com) will remain my general purpose
application security blog, so technical details for codesake will be wrote in
the codesake blog I'll publish soon. 

Due to openness love, one of the ruby gem I'll use as 
[core engine](https://github.com/codesake/sake) will be released as MIT Licensed
code. Please note that knowledge base and further other gems will be closed
source.
