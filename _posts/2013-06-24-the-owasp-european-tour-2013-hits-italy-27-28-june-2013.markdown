[Owasp](https://www.owasp.org) started an awareness tour this Summer in the
most important cities across Europe.

The idea is to spread the voice for application security to reach both security
researchers, companies, developers, universities and all people taking care
about their code.

[Owasp Italy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Italy) planned the Italian date
on next 27 June for the conference itself and next 28 June for the training
sessions.

The [event schedule](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/EUTour2013#Rome) is as usual impressive:
