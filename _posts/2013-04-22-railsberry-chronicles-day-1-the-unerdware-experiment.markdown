Today it was the first day for [railsberry](http://railsberry.com) event.
[Initial keynote](http://www.railsberry.com/speakers#chad) by Chad Fowler was
truly inspiring.

It was about experiment and embracing the change. A lot of times in my life I
do experienced the need of change.
Setting small goals and run yourself against _status quo_ is a great living
lesson.

<!-- more -->

For the technical talks I really loved 
[Eric Redmond](http://www.railsberry.com/speakers#eric) one about distributed
programming patterns. Truly awesome.

It deserves a mention also the latest talk from 
[Joseph Wilk](http://www.railsberry.com/speakers#joseph) about artificial intelligence
and how computer science it can be used in some amazing fields like music and
arts.

Joseph showed his researches in artificial intelligence while creating
[Haiku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) poems. Outstanding results. You
really want to learn more about it.

And tomorrow it will be [mine turn](http://www.railsberry.com/speakers#paolo).

Finger crossed to myself.
