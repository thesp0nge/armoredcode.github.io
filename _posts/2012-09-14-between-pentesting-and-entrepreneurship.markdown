Yesterday I was driving back home on my
[scooter](http://www.uk.vespa.com/#/vespa/IT/it/Modelli/Vespa-LX/Vespa-LX-125-ie).
It's a 40 minutes long trip and while surfing back and forth across crazy cars
not respecting speed limits I have got a lot of time to think.

A security specialist it's like an entrepreneur or a startupper... it must have
a strong culture of failure.

## The culture of failure...

Yesterday here in [Italy](http://www.italiastartup.it/), our Minister of
Economic Development [Corrado Passera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_Passera) attended to a startup
meeting near Venice. It was a great news in my country since startup culture is
something growing slowly in those years. 

He spoke about failure: _"Chi fallisce non è un fallito. Chi fallisce è chi ha
imparato qualcosa"_ that in English it would sound like: "Who fails it's not a
loser. Who fails he is someone he has learnt something"

{% blockquote %}
Chi fallisce non è un fallito. Chi fallisce è chi ha imparato qualcosa
{% endblockquote %}

## from penetration testers... 

An application security specialist (like anyone, on the other side) fails a lot
of times during his carreer. 
When you start testing a web application or an host for vulnerabilities it's
quite common that a non experienced tester would cause the target system to
crash.
It's common to make mistakes choosing the tool or tuning the scanning
parameters and being too aggressive (for a poorly written code).

Unexperience can drive you to make wrong assumptions and fill your reports with
false positives. 

Good [hackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) must learn and never give
up. This is obviously true in so many fields other than IT Security.

Pentester must be curious, they must read tons of blogs and online resources
and they ideally must learn something new every day.
They must not be scary about a new DBMS they wasn't aware about, or if they
find something strange a good approach is starting _googling_ at it.

This is the stream of consciousness it was in my mind yesterday around 6pm CEST.

## to startuppers.

I was also thinking about myself as startupper. 

Starting up this blog almost [6 month ago](http://armoredcode.com/blog/hello-world/) it was great and I'm collecting
more than 10.000 unique visitors and thank you for this.

[codesake.com](http://codesake.com) is my side project since last year and I'm
working almost in the darkness wrapping up code I'm writing and that you should
be aware about. Most of it is on [my github](https://github.com/thesp0nge)
personal repository.

I was very excited when I discovered that in 2009, some people put online [a
code review platform](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/pygr-dev/VLW4KxgMGIo)
based on github. The startup was called
[howsmycode.com](http://howsmycode.com/) and it was online at least until [15 March
2011](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110315000000*/http://howsmycode.com/).

Other competitors offering code review as SaaS are there and
[veracode](http://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/08/using-veracodes-saas-engine-to-quickly-roll-out-scanning-programs/)
is one of the most promising players in this field.

Actually, I don't know if I'll build codesake in some way or if I will release
a MVP or either if a day I'll appear on Gartner Magic Quadrant.

I just make a whole penetration test using [Owasp Testing guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents)
and some ruby code I wrote
([ciphersurfer](https://github.com/thesp0nge/ciphersurfer),
[enchant](https://github.com/thesp0nge/enchant) that it will be soon merged
into [links](https://github.com/thesp0nge/links)).

A set of ruby code that it will be the spine behind upcoming [codesake.com](http://codesake.com).
