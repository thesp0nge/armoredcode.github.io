Today I attended the [Italian RubyDay](http://rubyday.it) with a talk about application security.
More in details the talk was about how to use [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/en)
to automate some security tests as described in the [Owasp Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project).

## Something about the community

Meanwhile the afternoon talks' session is still ongoing, I can tell about the
good vide I had from this experience.
This was the first time I gave a talk for a software developer conference and I
was really nervous this morning.

Actually when talking in [Owasp Conferences](http://www.owasp.org) we are all
in the same IT area, with the same skills and the same expertize... well, true
to be told, there are a lot of great hackers at Owasp conference.

Talking about security in a for developers conference is a truly amazing
experience. It's like playing a soccer play as away team.

Ruby Italian community is small if compared to #java, #php or #js ones. I think
that it's driven by some resilience into the enterprise world to adopt new
technologies.

We're still stucking into the #java, #spring, #hibernate and #oracle
architectural pattern.

## Something doesn't change

As far as this morning slides weren't yet ready. The same old story applied. A
lot of stuff to do at work, Daniele drawing energies, my knee asking for
recovering and my sleeping needs, drove away from preparing a good talk in
those weeks.

This morning on the underground I packed up the [posts I'm writing on ruby for pentester topic](http://armoredcode.com/blog/categories/pentest-with-ruby/) in
a keynote and arranged my rubygems for the demo time.

Everything was fine, demos were affected by the demo effect and something
didn't work but I was very satisfied about the talk goes.

People made questions. People were interested in appsec topics.

It seems that developers **do care** about security and they want to learn more.

## Something I learnt today

Talking at developers conferences is fun. There are a lot of smart guys to talk
with, a lot of wine and interesting talks about new technologies.

As far as ruby programming language is strictly tied with the startup world,
there is a lot of energy in making business, inventing new services, creating
something new.

And in Italy we **do** need something new.

Ruby developers are either interested in #appsec topics. They are trained to
test their code with
[tdd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and
[bdd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) so introducing
some sort of security tests is just a matter of habits.

Here it is my talk slideshow. 
Enjoy it.
