My wife for my birthday last June she bought to me a [Kindle touch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005890G8Y/ref=famstripe_kt).

I really love it. The way ebooks will change publishing industry in the near
future, it's somewhat exciting. 

Indie authors like me and you can simple make their own creating and publishing
on the Net or better on some customized platforms like iTunes store and Amazon
Store.

Self publishing is so fascinating that I started my own:Â [Penetration testing with ruby: fingerprint your target](http://leanpub.com/penetration-test-with-ruby_fingerprint-your-target)

<!-- more -->

This ebook will introduce the reader into some fingerprint techniques a
security tester can use to gather as much informations as possibile form a web
application from a bunch of HTTP requests.

A developer can use it to understand the requests he can make to see how its
application looks like at attackers once online.

I think I'll work on this this August and Septembter, maybe I'll publish something on October.
