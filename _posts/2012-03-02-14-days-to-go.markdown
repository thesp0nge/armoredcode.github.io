## Developers do really need a new application security blog

At least this is what I hope for [this blog](http://armoredcode.com) I'm
launching next 16<sup>th</sup> of March.  

Crackers are very active in exploiting webapps those days. Stories are most of
time connected with politics and economical worldwide situation.

<!-- more -->

I think, and this is my only opinion, that some _so called_ hackers groups are
in search for notoriety instead of make some activism.

[r00tw0rm](http://twitter.com/r00tw0rm) crew hacked 
[united nation](http://thehackernews.com/2012/02/r00tw0rm-leak-united-nations.html) 
and [nasa](http://thehackernews.com/2012/02/nasa-own3d-again-nasa-database-leaked.html) databases.

As well [canon and
siemes](http://thehackernews.com/2012/03/siemens-and-canons-databases-exploited.html) 
database were hijacked and exposed to pastebin along people credentials.

## Look at the service door

I'm pretty sure that attackers didn't use the mainstream website to break those
databases. Instead they leverage chat websites, backoffice applications and
other entrypoints people deserve poor attention.

Addressing application security needs using tests, using secure coding best
practices is the only way to deploy strong and secure applications.

If you want more, we will focus testing in web applications with a series of
posts about [rspec](http://rspec.info), [cucumber](http://cukes.info),
[minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest), and how to address security
issues while developing the application.
