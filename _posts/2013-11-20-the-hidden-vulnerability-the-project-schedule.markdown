Keep it simple, stupid

When people designed Unix back in '70ies the aformentioned was the standard
rule to build something. A simple software can react well to changes. If you
are in late, you can easily disable one of two features of your big project
architecture if it was designed with simplicity in mind.

In most of modern _enterprise_ projects, bloatware is better. And resulting
scenario is an Armageddon.

## Enterprise, this obscure entity.

When you think to a typical startup around the world, you think at:

* agile development
* whiteboards full of stickers saying a feature has to be done / deleted /
  delayed
* informal and quick meetings
* getting things done 

The underlining non spoken fact is that people are playing with _big people_
money. So they need to go live with something working to attract customers and
able to go ahead to the road of being profitable.

A big company working on an internal product doesn't have all of those
constraints. And it's bed.
A big company is fully established, so usually it has an important (read
**big**) budget to spent on a website. Most of this budget however it will go
over for senior project managers, marketplace researches and one or two web
agencies luring internal customers with fancy mockups.

Usually, they have tons of meetings and most of times people talk about nothing related to the project. Who has strong opinions can fail, so people are plesed to chit
